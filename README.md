### Predictibility of Energy Use in Homes
http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~srollins/pubs/igcc14.pdf
<br>
<br>
Article that investigates the performance of following supervised learning techniques:
* Nearest-Neighbor (5NN)
* Naive Bayes predictor (Bayesian)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Auto-regressive and moving average model
Outtakes:
<i>"We show that <b>simple statistic-based algorithms perform as well as
sophisticated machine learning algorithms and time-series based
predictors </b>. These simple algorithms can considerably reduce the
computational need for large-scale predictive analysis of home
energy data. We also show that <b>appliance-level power draw is
more predictable than whole-home energy consumption </b> at shorter
time horizons while home-level energy consumption is more
predictable at longer time horizons. Finally, we show that there is
<b>large variation in predictability across homes</b>. This variation may
be attributed to home type and points to the need for personalized
energy management systems." </i>


### Classification of household appliances by electricity consumption

#### Article 1
http://www.hennebert.org/download/publications/isspa-2012-machine-learning-approaches-for-electrical-appliance-classification.pdf
<br>
<br>
This article proposes a machine learning classifier for identifying household appliances (e.g. whether it is a hair-dryer or a vacuum cleaner that is plugged into the outlet).

#### Article 2
Same topic as the article above. Written by 2 DTU professors (Jørgen Nørgård)
http://www.eceee.org/library/conference_proceedings/eceee_Summer_Studies/2009/Panel_4/4.411/paper
<br
<br>

#### Article 3
Proposes an algorithm, AppliSense, for recognizing appliances.
