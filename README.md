### Predictibility of Energy Use in Homes
http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~srollins/pubs/igcc14.pdf
<br>
<br>
Article that investigates the performance of following supervised learning techniques:
* Nearest-Neighbor (5NN)
* Naive Bayes predictor (Bayesian)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Auto-regressive and moving average model
Outtakes:
<i>"We show that <b>simple statistic-based algorithms perform as well as
sophisticated machine learning algorithms and time-series based
predictors </b>. These simple algorithms can considerably reduce the
computational need for large-scale predictive analysis of home
energy data. We also show that <b>appliance-level power draw is
more predictable than whole-home energy consumption </b> at shorter
time horizons while home-level energy consumption is more
predictable at longer time horizons. Finally, we show that there is
<b>large variation in predictability across homes</b>. This variation may
be attributed to home type and points to the need for personalized
energy management systems." </i>


### Identifying household appliances by power consumption

<br>
<br>
This article proposes a machine learning classifier for identifying household appliances (e.g. whether it is a hair-dryer or a vacuum cleaner that is plugged into the outlet).

### Electricity Load Forecasting

Article that investigates different algorithms to predict energy usage e.g. artificial neural networks
